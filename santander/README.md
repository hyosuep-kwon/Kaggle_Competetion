The data starts at 2015-01-28 and has monthly records of products a customer has, such as "credit card", "savings account", etc. You will predict what <strong>additional</strong> products a customer will get in the last month, 2016-06-28, in addition to what they already have at 2016-05-28. These products are the columns named:&nbsp;ind_(xyz)_ult1, which are the columns #25 - #48 in the training data. You will predict what a customer will buy <strong>in addition to what they already had at 2016-05-28</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The test and train sets are split by time, and public and private leaderboard sets are split randomly.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:&nbsp;This sample does not include any real Santander Spain customers, and thus it is not representative of Spain's customer base.&nbsp;</strong></p>
